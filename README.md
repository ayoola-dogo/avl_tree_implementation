# avl_tree_implementation
The implementation of an AVL Tree with insertion operation.
This is a self balancing binary tree - that checks if the tree is balanced after every new insertion operation and does several rotations based on if the tree is balanced or not balanced.
It also includes a few unittest cases to test some of the methods used in the implementation of the AVL Tree.
